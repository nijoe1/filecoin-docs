# Verify a contract

## Verification tools

The following FEVM-compatible chain explorers offer contract verification tools. For more information, click the appropriate link below.

## Verification tutorial with Filfox

The following guide walks you through the process of contract verification using the [Filfox](https://filfox.info/en/contract) explorer.

### Prerequisites

* A smart contract (`.sol` file)
* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

### Procedure

1. Open Remix:

2. In the **File Explorer** sidebar tab, under **contracts**, right click on the contract you want to verify.
3.  From the menu, select **generate UML** to flatten the `<contract-name>.sol` file and ensure that all components and tasks are included.

    A new contract with the name `<contract-name>_flattened.sol` is generated below your original contract.
4. Ensure that the license and Solidity version in the flattened contract is the same as in your original contract.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Right click on `<contract-name>_flattened.sol`.
7. In the menu, click **Download** to save the file.
8. Note the following information, as you will need it later:
   * The address of your deployed contract
   * The contract license type (if any)
   * The Solidity compiler version
9. Navigate to [Filfox](https://filfox.info/en/contract).
10. In the form, enter the information noted previously for the deployed contract you would like to verify:
    * The address
    * The license type
    * The compiler version

11. Click **Continue**.
12. Click \*_Select .sol files_.
13. Select your flattened `.sol` file.
14. Click **Verify and Publish**.

```
2.  Scroll down the contract page and select the **Contract** tab.

    A **Contract Source Code Verified** banner is displayed, along with contract information and source code. You can also [view other verified contracts on Filfox](https://filfox.info/en/stats/verified-contracts).
